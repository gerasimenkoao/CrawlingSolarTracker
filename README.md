# CrawlingSolarTracker
Easy camping solar tracker for 100W panel.

Its need only few components:
1. Digispark with L78M05 voltge regulator (as on photo).
2. 5V 28BYJ-48 stpepper motor with ULN2003 board and wires.
3. Two GL-5528 photoresistor and 2 wheels for stepper.
some printed parts or metal mounts 4 motor.

Making the system a piece of cake:
1. Load sketch Tracker.ino to digispark.
2. Wiring components as on Schematic.jpg
3. Mount it on solar panel.
(Printed parts must be from a white plastic!!!)

Thats it!
Place the system on a level surface with the top support point of the solar panel.
After the sun appears, the system will crawl to the correct position by itself ;-)

Characteristics:
Positioning accuracy - 5 degrees (corrections every 20 minutes)
Efficiency: up to 30% daily energy production.

Current consumption:
less than 30mA in idle state
less than 300mA when stepper work
